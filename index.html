								I've used AWS. It's great, but sometimes you want to do things yourself. That's why I have my own web server hosted on my home network. It's a Raspberry Pi running a LAMP stack where I host all my crazier and unfinished ideas. Check them out here!

							<div class="panel-body">
								While learning a bit of Angular.js, I ended up making a small application for guessing the United States in alphabetical order. This was my first time working with Angular and I'll probably have more angular projects in the future. For now, have fun guessing states!

								I've created desk lamps before, but this one is unique. This lamp has a built in technology that allows you to change the light intensity with the wave of a hand. I had a lot of fun with this project because it combines design, 3D-printing, and Arduino stuff in one thing.

								<p><b>Web Developer</b></p>
								<p>During my time at Norfolk Southern, a few collegues and I developed a web based support tool for asset tracking. This custom tool enabled different IT support groups to interact seemlessly with each other, despite having their own processes and definitions for success. It was a goal of ours to bring all support groups under one unified interface. As we integrated more features and ideas, our roles evolved into developers for this support tool.</p>
								<p><b>Support Analyst</b></p>
								<p>My team and I were level 3 support for rugged mobile tablets in the field. These devies are used by train conductors all over the eastern US for real-time inventory tracking and customer updates over a cellular connection.</p>
